I've spent a lot of time working with drinking water data. This page is meant to save others time as they start to research drinking water or work on water policy. If you're brand new, I would recommend starting with EPA's [drinking water data clearinghouse](https://www.epa.gov/DWdata). The following are data resources frequently come up in my work, but please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:austin.wes@epa.gov) if you have questions or need help finding drinking water data. 


## The Basics: SDWIS

The Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) is the go-to data source for information on drinking water systems in the US. For all active water systems, it includes information on their primary sourcewater characteristics, number of people served, number of service connections, type of system for regulatory purposes, and of course information on all violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act.

## Service Boundaries

Service boundaries are the geographic extent of a water system's customer base. They have a ton of analytic uses. Many states post their service boundaries publicly, and these have been compiled and combined with modeled boundaries in the following EPA, SimpleLab/EPIC, and USGS datasets.
- EPA (2024). Community Water System Service Area Boundaries. [https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/community-water-system-service-area-boundaries?tab=resources](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/community-water-system-service-area-boundaries?tab=resources)
- SimpleLab, EPIC (2022). U.S. Community Water Systems Service Boundaries, v3.0.0, HydroShare, [http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/9ebc0a0b43b843b9835830ffffdd971e](http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/9ebc0a0b43b843b9835830ffffdd971e)

## Safe Drinking Water Act Compliance Monitoring Samples

Drinking water systems collect samples of raw and finished drinking water for hundreds of water quality parameters. Some states post these samples publicly, and many use a Drinking Water Watch website. EPA has compiled [a list of these state websites if you'd like to check them out.](https://www.epa.gov/DWdata/primacy-agency-drinking-water-data) 

EPA has also assembled drinking water sampling data as part of the [National Contaminant Occurrence Database](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/national-contaminant-occurrence-database-ncod). 
There are additional datasets that cover some or all of the US. 
- [Six Year Review](https://www.epa.gov/dwsixyearreview): As part of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which requires the US EPA to regularly revisit and reconsider its drinking water standards, EPA collects SDWA compliance samples through an information collection request of primacy agencies (i.e., states). It currently covers 1998 - 2019, although coverage varies by state and contaminant over time. 
- [Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule Data](https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/occurrence-data-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule#5): The UCMR is used to collect occurrence information for contaminants that are not regulated as part of the Safe Drinking Water Act at the time of sampling. Contaminant data has been collected in five separate waves from 2001 - 2025. The UCMR uses a representative sampling protocol across public water systems, thus coverage is more limited across sytems than for the SYR. Each wave of sampling is also limited to a specific set of target contaminants. 
 
Other datasets featuring drinking water sampling information include:
- [The National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/): The CDC collects information on 12 drinking water contaminants of concern from 28 states over 2001-2021. The tracking tool allows easy download after customizing your data query. 
- [Environmental Working Group Tap Water Databse](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/): Another resource for finding information on drinking water quality.   



## Private Domestic Wells 

Private domestic wells are not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and so they're an important potential area of study. First, however, you have to know where the wells are. The following study can help in this regard, and you can find [the underlying data for the project here](https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7ffe9ca0a2044e9c8e2b8f256c99525f).
