title: Drinking Water Data

I've spent a lot of time working with drinking water data. This page is meant to hopefully save others time as they start to research drinking water or work on water policy. If you're interested in additional data that you don't see here, please feel free to get in touch! 


## The Basics

- Safe Drinking Water Information System: The go-to data source for information on drinking water systems in the US. For all active water systems, it includes information on their primary sourcewater characteristics, number of people served, number of service connections, type of system for regulatory purposes, and of course information on all violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act.

  - [Version 2](https://obipublic.epa.gov/analytics/saw.dll?PortalPages&PortalPath=/shared/SFDW/_portal/Public&Page=Summary)


## Service Boundaries

Service boundaries are the geographic extent of a water system's customer base. They have a ton of analytic uses. Many states post their service boundaries publicly, and these have been compiled and combined with modeled boundaries in the following SimpleLab/EPIC dataset. There is also another dataset on public supply water service areas produced by the US Geological Survey linked below as well.

## Safe Drinking Water Act Compliance Monitoring Samples

Drinking water systems collect samples of raw and finished drinking water for hundreds of water quality parameters. Some states post these samples on their website, especially as part of standardized Drinking Water Watch websites.

As part of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which requires the US EPA to revisit its drinking water standards in a Six Year Review process, EPA collects some of these SDWA compliance samples and posts them after significant data quality assurance and control protocols. Here are links to some of the prior Six Year Review datasets:
